📊 Customer Segmentation for Debt Repayment Analysis

📌 Overview
This project uses machine learning to segment customers based on debt repayment behavior. We apply K-Means to identify patterns and provide insights that can help in targeted collection and marketing strategies.

🚀 Features
✔ Customer Segmentation: Classifying customers into distinct groups based on payment behavior.
✔ Clustering: Using K-Means to identify patterns within the data.
✔ Data Analysis: Exploring and preprocessing data to understand its key characteristics.
✔ Strategic Insights: Recommendations for personalized actions based on the identified clusters.

📂 Dataset
Records: ~10,000 customers
Columns: Examples include Customer ID, Age, Income, Debt Amount, Payment Status, among others.

🛠️ Technologies

Python: Main programming language used for the project
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing
Scikit-Learn: Machine learning algorithms (K-Means)
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
